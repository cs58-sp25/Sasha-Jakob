init the stuff
Create two pcbs
put the usercontext passed into kernel start in the first one
malloc a new user context
memcopy the first user context into the new malloc
put the new user context into doidle

depending on how kernel context works
copy that as well
add to doidle

Do something with kernel contexts
for doidle pcb put the program counter into usercontext
add to ready queue the doidle pcb
for init pcb (this has the current usercontext in it)
	call load program on it to load init into the process

set current process status to PROCESS_READY
maybe do some other stuff idk
set current process to init pcb
