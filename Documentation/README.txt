Yalnix-OS
Checkpoint 2 information:
For this checkpoint we did not submit it on time due to errors with getting the Yalnix_Framework directory to properly work with the compiler. Someone accidentally changed the file structure in it and added a bunch of files (its fixed now) but at the time we spent multiple days trying to get our code to compile untill I realized that the Yalnix Framework directory was different than originally intended. This is the reason we submitted late.

Bugs/Obstacles:
There is a permission error with the yalnix_framework/etc/yalnixdisk being accessed and I wasnt able to fix it using chmod, aside from that kernel start and doidle should work properly
